league 39 -> Premier league
links -> animate b4 , b5 , font awesome

serie a - 135 id

ligue 1 -> 61
bundesliga -> 78
isl -> 323

encryption -> encode and decode -> not useful for today as two way process and we can decode the cipher easily (cryptii)

hashing -> one way communication -> awfwaf.fawfaew.fegas -> this cannot be converted into original

md5(md5 online) <  sha-1 < whitlpool -> scrypt < bcrypt  (hashing power) 


JWT 
json web tokens -> after a cookie has been saved for a particular user , next time when he continues his work , that user specificity is maintained by jwt 
cookies are different and unique for different users , a hash code is generated by jwt which reminsices the server about the user validation, maintained in header field of http proto , 
jwt is authentication for a user after they have logged in , avoiding frequent authentication interruptions for user 

the jwt encoded data contains three 2 dots and three parts -> header(algo , tokens) , payload(id , issueid) , verify signature(secret code) 

DOT env -> anonymosity of KEYS used 

jwt tokens are stored in cookies. after signup tokens are generated and stored in cookies for each user.

cookie parser is used for getting values inside cookie.
